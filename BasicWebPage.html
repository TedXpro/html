        There are two types of programs you can create with Java: applications
        and applets. An application is a stand alone program that runs on your
        computer. Applets are Java porgrams that are usually part of a web site.
        Ther ayre stored on a web serber along with the site's web pages. when a 
        remote user accesses a web page with her or her browser, any applets
        associated with the web page are transmitted over the Internet from the 
        server to the rmote user's system.
